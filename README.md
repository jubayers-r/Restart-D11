## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **Cricket Team Selection App** is a React-based application that allows users to build their own cricket team by selecting players while managing a limited budget. This app follows a design specification provided via Figma, featuring a sleek and intuitive user interface. Users can select, view, and remove players from their team while keeping track of their available coins.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **React.js** - Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **React-Toastify** - For smooth toast notifications and alerts.
- **TAILWINDCSS** - Styling freamwork to replicate the Figma design.
- **JSON** - For storing player data (name, role, country, etc.).

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. **Dynamic Player Selection**
   Users can browse and select cricket players from a list, with each player card displaying essential details such as name, country, role, and price. The app checks if the user has enough coins to select the player and prevents selecting the same player more than once.

2. **Real-Time Coin Tracking**
   The user's available coins are displayed on the navbar and updated in real-time as players are selected. Users start with zero coins and earn coins through button interactions.

3. **Player Removal & Add More Players**
   Users can remove players from their selected team with a simple click and can always add more players as long as they havenâ€™t reached the team selection limit.
